Applicative order will cause infinite recursion, as arguments are evaluated
before functions are called. This causes the the recursively defined (p) to
evaluate before test is called.

For normal order, the second argument expression will be passed into the
test function without evaluation, and since the first argument is zero, it will
never be evaluted, causing the call to test to resolve without infinite
recursion.
